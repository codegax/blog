I had the incredible opportunity to attend the Microsoft AI Tour, and I want to share some of the key takeaways from the talks I attended.

This blog will be a bit lengthy, but I trust it will be very useful if you're interested in how artificial intelligence is transforming various industries.

<!--more-->

My main notes and findings were:

- AI should be driven by business needs rather than just technology.
- The biggest challenge is the shortage of talent in AI.
- Manufacturing companies are already exploring and experimenting with AI.
- Mexico is one of the countries that will invest the most in AI in the coming years.
- At the end of the blog, I’ll include my notes on the keynote by Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, as a closing to this analysis.
